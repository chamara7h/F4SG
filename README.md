# F4SG Learning Labs

Welcome to the **Forecasting for Social Good (F4SG) Learning Labs** GitHub repository! This repository houses all the materials, code, and resources used in our workshops, dedicated to teaching forecasting techniques with **R** and **Python** for social good applications. Our Learning Labs provide practical, hands-on training aimed at empowering researchers, practitioners, and anyone interested in using data-driven forecasting methods for positive social impact.

## About F4SG Learning Labs

The **F4SG Learning Labs** are part of the larger [F4SG Research Network](https://www.linkedin.com/company/f4sg), an international network of researchers and practitioners working in the field of Forecasting for Social Good. Through these free workshops, we aim to:

- **Equip participants with methodological knowledge** for forecasting.
- **Provide practical coding demonstrations** in R and Python, showing how to implement forecasting models.
- **Promote knowledge-sharing** by making all materials freely accessible and open-source.

## What Youâ€™ll Find Here

This repository contains:
- **Workshop Materials**: Presentation slides, lecture notes, and examples for each workshop.
- **Code Examples**: R and Python code for forecasting models, including time series forecasting, machine learning applications, and data preprocessing.
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step tutorials for each session to support learning and implementation.
- **Data Sets**: Sample data sets for practice exercises and demonstrations.
