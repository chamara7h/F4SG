# F4SG: A tutorial on forecasting electricity demand.

In this notebook, we explore an electricity demand dataset in Belgium in 2018 and 2019. The ambient temperature during this period is also provided. Using historical data and exogenous variables, we explore different methods to forecast the electricity demand in a defined test period.

This notebook is divided into three parts:

1. Understanding the data
2. Creating baseline forecasters
3. Creating forecasters using machine learning
